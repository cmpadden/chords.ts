## Objective

This library provides a way to identify chord names, and the associated root note, given a sequence of notes or MIDI intervals.

## Contributions

Contributions & collaboration are very much welcome. This is meant to be a fun
side-project that stemmed from an interest in how the chord-identifier works in
Logic Pro. This initial prototype is likely a naive solution, and
recommendations for alternative approaches are most definitely welcome!
